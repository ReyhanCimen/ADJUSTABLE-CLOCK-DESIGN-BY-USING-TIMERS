# ADJUSTABLE-CLOCK-DESIGN-BY-USING-TIMERS
This Arduino project implements a fully adjustable digital clock using Timer1 of the AVR microcontroller. It keeps track of hours, minutes, and seconds, and displays the current time on a 16×2 RGB LCD in HH:MM:SS format. A push button on pin 4 is used to adjust the clock: a single press within 2 seconds allows the user to set the hour via values sent through the Serial interface, while a double press within 2 seconds sets the minutes. Two LEDs connected to pins 8 and 9 indicate which adjustment is active—both LEDs light for hour adjustment, and LED1 lights for minute adjustment. The clock uses Timer1 in CTC mode to increment time every second, demonstrates interrupt-driven timing, button debouncing, and integrates user input through UART, making it a practical example of combining timers, interrupts, and output control in embedded systems.
